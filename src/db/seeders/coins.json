Some strategies involve securely lending the assets to earn interest, providing liquidity to traders, or \"farming\" the governance tokens of [](https://badger.com/partners)other DeFi protocols. \n\nSome Vaults are upgradable, meaning they can switch between strategies when new opportunities become available.\n\n2) ibBTC token \n\nInterest Bearing Bitcoin (ibBTC) is a fully collateralized representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum, Matic, and BSC.

It allows users to bring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain into Ethereum, and receive either a renBTC or WBTC token. Both renBTC and wBTC are fully collateralized representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum, meaning they are backed 1:1 with Bitcoin and can be swapped back into BTC at any time with very low slippage.\n\nBoth renBTC and wBTC may be deposited into Sett Vaults to earn yield, used as collateral on other protocols, swapped for different tokens, or any of the hundreds of other uses across DeFi.\n\n4) Badger Boost\n\nBadger Boost encourages users to participate in governance and support the BadgerDAO ecosystem by holding Badger native assets - BADGER and DIGG in their wallets. For that, users are rewarded with BADGER tokens.\n\nBadger Boost adjusts the amount of BADGER rewards a user receives, based on the ratio of a user's native balance (bBadger or a DIGG LP) compared to a non-native balance (funds deposited into BTC Setts). The higher the native balance, the more BADGER token rewards users receive on non-native Vault positions.\n\n5) DIGG\n\nDIGG is the first decentralized, elastic supply crypto asset pegged to the price of Bitcoin. Unlike custodial forms of BTC on Ethereum, DIGG is not backed by Bitcoin under management. Instead, DIGG relies on parameters built into its smart contracts in order to maintain a loose peg to BTC.\n\nEvery day, a rebase occurs. If the price of DIGG is greater than 1.05 BTC, a positive rebase occurs and the supply of DIGG in wallets and smart contracts increases. If the price is under .95 BTC, the supply decreases. If the price is between .95 and 1.05 BTC, the supply remains unchanged.\n\nThe smart contract works to push the circulating supply of DIGG closer to an equilibrium where the market demands an amount of DIGG such that its price equals the current price of BTC. Rebases change the number of DIGG tokens users see in their wallet, but does not change the percentage ownership of the total supply.\n\nHolding DIGG in the wallet (or staked as bDIGG) increases APYs in other Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nBADGER is the native governance token of BadgerDAO.

Users are able to create ibBTC by providing byvWBTC, bCrvRenWBTC, bCrvRenWSBTC, or bCrvtBTC tokens.\n\nOnce minted, BadgerDAO manages the assets to provide a base interest rate that is derived from the return of the underlying Sett Vaults. ibBTC may be redeemed for the underlying vault tokens at any time or traded on exchanges like Sushiswap.\n\nWhile the ibBTC token already earns yield from holding it, owners are also able to deposit the ibBTC token together with the WBTC token as liquidity to Sushiswap pools and earn SUSHI tokens as a reward.\n\n3) Badger Bridge \n\nBadger Bridge is a core product of BadgerDAO, managed in collaboration with the Ren Protocol. It allows users to bring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain into Ethereum, and receive either a renBTC or WBTC token. Both renBTC and wBTC are fully collateralized representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum, meaning they are backed 1:1 with Bitcoin and can be swapped back into BTC at any time with very low slippage.\n\nBoth renBTC and wBTC may be deposited into Sett Vaults to earn yield, used as collateral on other protocols, swapped for different tokens, or any of the hundreds of other uses across DeFi.\n\n4) Badger Boost\n\nBadger Boost encourages users to participate in governance and support the BadgerDAO ecosystem by holding Badger native assets - BADGER and DIGG in their wallets. For that, users are rewarded with BADGER tokens.\n\nBadger Boost adjusts the amount of BADGER rewards a user receives, based on the ratio of a user's native balance (bBadger or a DIGG LP) compared to a non-native balance (funds deposited into BTC Setts). The higher the native balance, the more BADGER token rewards users receive on non-native Vault positions.\n\n5) DIGG\n\nDIGG is the first decentralized, elastic supply crypto asset pegged to the price of Bitcoin. Unlike custodial forms of BTC on Ethereum, DIGG is not backed by Bitcoin under management. Instead, DIGG relies on parameters built into its smart contracts in order to maintain a loose peg to BTC.\n\nEvery day, a rebase occurs. If the price of DIGG is greater than 1.05 BTC, a positive rebase occurs and the supply of DIGG in wallets and smart contracts increases. If the price is under .95 BTC, the supply decreases. If the price is between .95 and 1.05 BTC, the supply remains unchanged.\n\nThe smart contract works to push the circulating supply of DIGG closer to an equilibrium where the market demands an amount of DIGG such that its price equals the current price of BTC. Rebases change the number of DIGG tokens users see in their wallet, but does not change the percentage ownership of the total supply.\n\nHolding DIGG in the wallet (or staked as bDIGG) increases APYs in other Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nBADGER is the native governance token of BadgerDAO. It is an ERC-20 token with a maximum fixed supply of 21 million. It is currently traded on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, with support for Fantom coming soon.\n\nThe BADGER token has the following applications:\n\n- BADGER tokens give its owner the right to vote in the governance of BadgerDAO, including product mix, leadership, treasury allocation, and community initiatives. The governance of Badger Finance is managed via an Aragon DAO.\n- BADGER can also be used to earn staking rewards and as collateral on different platforms across DeFi.\n- Holding BADGER in your wallet (or staked as bBADGER) increases your APYs in other Sett Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThe Badger governance token ($BADGER) and the Digg token ($DIGG) аrе distributed via airdrops for users:\n\n- who have demonstrated an active interest in Bitcoin DeFi and community governance\n- are early contributors to the DAO,\n- and as staking rewards for participation in Sett.", "fa": "**Project Description**\n\nBadgerDAO is an open-source, decentralized autonomous organization that is dedicated to building products and infrastructure, simplifying the use of Bitcoin as collateral across many smart contract platforms like Ethereum. \n\nIn simple terms, Badger enables earning DeFi yields on your Bitcoin.

Users are able to create ibBTC by providing byvWBTC, bCrvRenWBTC, bCrvRenWSBTC, or bCrvtBTC tokens.\n\nOnce minted, BadgerDAO manages the assets to provide a base interest rate that is derived from the return of the underlying Sett Vaults. ibBTC may be redeemed for the underlying vault tokens at any time or traded on exchanges like Sushiswap.\n\nWhile the ibBTC token already earns yield from holding it, owners are also able to deposit the ibBTC token together with the WBTC token as liquidity to Sushiswap pools and earn SUSHI tokens as a reward.\n\n3) Badger Bridge \n\nBadger Bridge is a core product of BadgerDAO, managed in collaboration with the Ren Protocol. It allows users to bring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain into Ethereum, and receive either a renBTC or WBTC token. Both renBTC and wBTC are fully collateralized representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum, meaning they are backed 1:1 with Bitcoin and can be swapped back into BTC at any time with very low slippage.\n\nBoth renBTC and wBTC may be deposited into Sett Vaults to earn yield, used as collateral on other protocols, swapped for different tokens, or any of the hundreds of other uses across DeFi.\n\n4) Badger Boost\n\nBadger Boost encourages users to participate in governance and support the BadgerDAO ecosystem by holding Badger native assets - BADGER and DIGG in their wallets. For that, users are rewarded with BADGER tokens.\n\nBadger Boost adjusts the amount of BADGER rewards a user receives, based on the ratio of a user's native balance (bBadger or a DIGG LP) compared to a non-native balance (funds deposited into BTC Setts). The higher the native balance, the more BADGER token rewards users receive on non-native Vault positions.\n\n5) DIGG\n\nDIGG is the first decentralized, elastic supply crypto asset pegged to the price of Bitcoin. Unlike custodial forms of BTC on Ethereum, DIGG is not backed by Bitcoin under management. Instead, DIGG relies on parameters built into its smart contracts in order to maintain a loose peg to BTC.\n\nEvery day, a rebase occurs. If the price of DIGG is greater than 1.05 BTC, a positive rebase occurs and the supply of DIGG in wallets and smart contracts increases. If the price is under .95 BTC, the supply decreases. If the price is between .95 and 1.05 BTC, the supply remains unchanged.\n\nThe smart contract works to push the circulating supply of DIGG closer to an equilibrium where the market demands an amount of DIGG such that its price equals the current price of BTC. Rebases change the number of DIGG tokens users see in their wallet, but does not change the percentage ownership of the total supply.\n\nHolding DIGG in the wallet (or staked as bDIGG) increases APYs in other Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nBADGER is the native governance token of BadgerDAO. It is an ERC-20 token with a maximum fixed supply of 21 million. It is currently traded on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, with support for Fantom coming soon.\n\nThe BADGER token has the following applications:\n\n- BADGER tokens give its owner the right to vote in the governance of BadgerDAO, including product mix, leadership, treasury allocation, and community initiatives. The governance of Badger Finance is managed via an Aragon DAO.\n- BADGER can also be used to earn staking rewards and as collateral on different platforms across DeFi.\n- Holding BADGER in your wallet (or staked as bBADGER) increases your APYs in other Sett Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThe Badger governance token ($BADGER) and the Digg token ($DIGG) аrе distributed via airdrops for users:\n\n- who have demonstrated an active interest in Bitcoin DeFi and community governance\n- are early contributors to the DAO,\n- and as staking rewards for participation in Sett."}, "genesis_date" : "2020-12-03"},

  {"uid" : "nucypher", "security" : null, "description" : {"de": "**Project Description**\n\nThe NuCypher network is a decentralized network offering accessible, intuitive, and extensible environment for secrets management and dynamic access control. NuCypher is a data encryption and protection layer for Ethereum (and other networks) that does not rely on a central service provider. \n\nThe NuCypher protocol, which the team calls a decentralized key management system (KMS), aims to give developers the ability to store, share, and manage private data on public blockchains. Potential use cases include secret data management, dynamic access control and secure computation.\n\nDevelopers receive this encryption service via a network of NuCypher nodes in exchange for a fee (paid for in ETH). The NuCypher network participants can only spin up a node by staking NyCypher's token, NU, on the network as collateral.\n\nIn a world of public blockchains, NuCypher network provides a secure layer to manage sensitive data. In practice, NuCypher works in the following manner: \n\n1. Alice, the data owner, encrypts some sensitive data with her public key and uploads it to IPFS, Swarm, S3, or any other storage layer. \n2. To delegate access to valid recipients, Alice creates and uploads re-encryption keys to the NuCypher network.\n3. Ursula, a miner, receives the re-encryption keys and stands ready to re-key data in exchange for payment in fees and block rewards. Ursula and the storage layer never have access to Alice's plaintext data.\n4. Bob, a data recipient, sends an access request to the NuCypher network. If a valid re-encryption key exists, the data is re-keyed to his public key and he can decrypt with his private key.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nNuCypher's native token, NU, serves as a work token that gives holders the right to:\n\n- run a node on the network.

  {"uid" : "polkastarter", "security" : null, "description" : {"de": "**Project Description**\n\nPolkastarter is a launchpad platform designed to provide an easy to use system for raising capital across mulitple blockchains. It enables early-stage blockchain projects to raise capital and distribute their tokens to community. At the same time, Polkastarter also enables independent inevstors to discover and invest in promising projects in early stages.\n\nThe platform went live in December 2020, and has quickly grown to become a commonly used platform for initial DEX offerings (IDOs). IDOs are the successor of other crypto fundraising models, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Offering better and immediate liquidity at every price level due to its mechanics, IDOs are an excellent choice for new projects and startups keen to launch a token and access immediate funds.\n\nUnlike the aforementioned fundraising methods, IDOs are generally considered a fair way to launch a new cryptocurrency project by avoiding pre-mines, which is an issuance system that favors project founders over community members.\n\nPolkastarter's main offering is its fixed swap smart contract, which allows projects to easily launch liquidity pools that execute orders at a fixed price — rather than using the AMM model.\n\nThe platform is designed to handle a range of auction types, including sealed-bid and dutch auctions, as well as both fixed and dynamic ratio swaps. This makes it suitable for cryptocurrency projects looking to raise funds, as well as a variety of other use-cases, including private trades, OTC deals, and discounted sales.\n\nBeyond this, other key features of the platform include permissionless listings, anti-scam capabilities, full KYC integration and liquidity mining.\n\nPolkastarter allows raising funds from following blockchains:\n\n- Ethereum (ETH)\n- Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\n- Polkadot (DOT)\n- Solana (SOL)\n- Kusama (KSM)\n- Polygon (MATIC)\n\n**Token Description**\n\nPOLS is the native utility token of the Polkastarter platform and plays a number of roles in its ecosystem. It can be used to:\n\n- participate in POLS staking. Users are only eligible for staking after providing liquidity to the Polkastarter pools.\n- participate liquidity mining.

  {"uid" : "secret", "security" : null, "description" : {"de": "**Project Description**\n\nSecret Network is the first smart-contract enabled blockchain that preserves privacy. \n\nSecret Network went live on Feb. 13, 2020 and initially went under the name Enigma. The Enigma team announced the network's launch on the same day it revealed its settlement with the U.S. SEC over Enigma's $45 million ICO in 2017. In May 2020, the project rebranded to Secret Network. Enigma MPC (the company behind the original Enigma protocol) is now one of several development groups that contribute to Secret Network's underlying technology.\n\nMost blockchains that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum, are public by default. This means all the data used in their smart contracts is exposed to the public. Secret Network improves upon traditionally public smart contracts by supporting encrypted inputs, encrypted outputs, and encrypted state for smart contracts.

When a user decides to make a withdrawal, the user must provide proof that he or she possesses a secret corresponding to one of the smart contract’s list of deposits.\n\n- zk-SNARK technology allows this proof to be verified without the need for the user to reveal which exact deposit corresponds to their secret.\n- The smart contract then checks the proof, and transfers deposited funds to the address specified by the withdrawal transaction.\n- Any external observer is unable to determine which deposit this withdrawal is linked to.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nTORN is Tornado Cash’s native governance token. It’s a fixed-supply ERC20 token that is used for voting on protocol governance and upgrades.\n\nAbout 10% of TORN token supply is being distrbuted to liquidity providers via Anonymity mining program to increase protocol efficiency and its privacy strength. Anonymity mining allows liquidity providers to earn TORN tokens by depositing their assets (ETH, WBTC, DAI or cDAI) into the protocol. This incentive began on December 18, 2020 and expected to end on December 18, 2021.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThe TORN governance token has a fixed total supply of 10,000,000. All tokes are being allocated in the following manner:\n\n- 5% of the supply is allocated to protocol users via an airdrop,\n- 10% to liquidity mining rewards (distributed linearly over 1 year),\n- 30% to founding developers and early supporters (unlocked over 3 years with a 1 year cliff).\n- 55% to the protocol treasury (unlocked linearly over 5 years)."}, "genesis_date" : null},

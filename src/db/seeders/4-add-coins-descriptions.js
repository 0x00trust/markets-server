Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized or undercollateralized fashion.\n\nA borrower must lock collateral in crypto that is valued higher than the amount being borrowed. The borrowed amount typically can not exceed 50-75% of the collateral value. If the USD value of a user’s collateral falls below the necessary collateralization threshold, their funds are posted for liquidation and can be purchased at a discount by other users within the system. \n\nAave was the first to introduce the concept of flash loans. This function lets users borrow large amounts with no collateral but for a fee of 0.3%. These loans are risk-free for the Aave platform and have a life span of a fraction of a second. The loan is given at the beginning of the transaction and paid back at the end of it. If it has not been paid back, every action the user took with that loan is canceled.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nAAVE is used to vote and decide on the outcome of Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). \n\nApart from this, AAVE can be staked within the protocol Safety Module to provide security and insurance to the protocol and depositors. Stakers earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol.\n\nThe AAVE token is also used to pay for fees when interacting with the Aave service. The AAVE collected as fees are then burned making it a deflationary asset. \n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThe Aave protocol has a supply of 16 million AAVE tokens.\n\nIn 2017, ETHlend ran an ICO where it sold 77% of the LEND tokens at a price of 1.6 cents each. Over 1 billion of its 1.3 billion total supply was sold, raising over 16 million USD. \n\nLater when the project rebranded, the tokens were denominated i.e. 100 LEND = 1 AAVE.\n\nAbout 23% of the tokens were kept by the founders and developers of the project.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Low\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> Yes', en: '**Project Description**\n\nFormerly known as ETHlend, Aave was the first DeFi lending protocol when it launched its first main net as ETHlend in 2017.\n\nAave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers.

  { uid: 'badger-dao', description: { de: "**Project Description**\n\nBadgerDAO is an open-source, decentralized autonomous organization that is dedicated to building products and infrastructure, simplifying the use of Bitcoin as collateral across many smart contract platforms like Ethereum. \n\nIn simple terms, Badger enables earning DeFi yields on your Bitcoin. Badger provides tools that allow someone to bring Bitcoin into the DeFi ecosystem and earn the best risk-adjusted yield possible, automatically rebalancing into better strategies as they become available.\n\nThe platform is a shared space where the developers, known as Badge Builders, have the ability to collaborate and implement Bitcoin as collateral to as many blockchains as possible. \n\nThere is an incentive for developers to build on the platform as they can earn a percentage of the fees from users and BADGER tokens from the developer pool for every implementation.\n\nBadger DAO products include:\n\n1) Sett Vaults\n\nAllow someone to deposit over twenty Bitcoin-linked crypto assets into smart contracts that execute automated strategies to achieve some of the best risk-adjusted rewards across DeFi. Some strategies involve securely lending the assets to earn interest, providing liquidity to traders, or \"farming\" the governance tokens of other DeFi protocols. \n\nSome Vaults are upgradable, meaning they can switch between strategies when new opportunities become available.\n\n2) ibBTC token \n\nInterest Bearing Bitcoin (ibBTC) is a fully collateralized representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum, Matic, and BSC. The goal of ibBTC is to become the most liquid, secure, and widely used BTC-backed asset throughout DeFi, while at the same time providing users with a base interest rate from holding it. \n\nBuilt in collaboration with DefiDollar, ibBTC is an index of the top Bitcoin-pegged assets in DeFi, including wBTC, renBTC, sBTC, and tBTC. Users are able to create ibBTC by providing byvWBTC, bCrvRenWBTC, bCrvRenWSBTC, or bCrvtBTC tokens.\n\nOnce minted, BadgerDAO manages the assets to provide a base interest rate that is derived from the return of the underlying Sett Vaults. ibBTC may be redeemed for the underlying vault tokens at any time or traded on exchanges like Sushiswap.\n\nWhile the ibBTC token already earns yield from holding it, owners are also able to deposit the ibBTC token together with the WBTC token as liquidity to Sushiswap pools and earn SUSHI tokens as a reward.\n\n3) Badger Bridge \n\nBadger Bridge is a core product of BadgerDAO, managed in collaboration with the Ren Protocol. It allows users to bring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain into Ethereum, and receive either a renBTC or WBTC token. Both renBTC and wBTC are fully collateralized representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum, meaning they are backed 1:1 with Bitcoin and can be swapped back into BTC at any time with very low slippage.\n\nBoth renBTC and wBTC may be deposited into Sett Vaults to earn yield, used as collateral on other protocols, swapped for different tokens, or any of the hundreds of other uses across DeFi.\n\n4) Badger Boost\n\nBadger Boost encourages users to participate in governance and support the BadgerDAO ecosystem by holding Badger native assets - BADGER and DIGG in their wallets. For that, users are rewarded with BADGER tokens.\n\nBadger Boost adjusts the amount of BADGER rewards a user receives, based on the ratio of a user's native balance (bBadger or a DIGG LP) compared to a non-native balance (funds deposited into BTC Setts). The higher the native balance, the more BADGER token rewards users receive on non-native Vault positions.\n\n5) DIGG\n\nDIGG is the first decentralized, elastic supply crypto asset pegged to the price of Bitcoin. Unlike custodial forms of BTC on Ethereum, DIGG is not backed by Bitcoin under management. Instead, DIGG relies on parameters built into its smart contracts in order to maintain a loose peg to BTC.\n\nEvery day, a rebase occurs. If the price of DIGG is greater than 1.05 BTC, a positive rebase occurs and the supply of DIGG in wallets and smart contracts increases. If the price is under .95 BTC, the supply decreases. If the price is between .95 and 1.05 BTC, the supply remains unchanged.\n\nThe smart contract works to push the circulating supply of DIGG closer to an equilibrium where the market demands an amount of DIGG such that its price equals the current price of BTC. Rebases change the number of DIGG tokens users see in their wallet, but does not change the percentage ownership of the total supply.\n\nHolding DIGG in the wallet (or staked as bDIGG) increases APYs in other Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nBADGER is the native governance token of BadgerDAO. It is an ERC-20 token with a maximum fixed supply of 21 million. It is currently traded on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, with support for Fantom coming soon.\n\nThe BADGER token has the following applications:\n\n- BADGER tokens give its owner the right to vote in the governance of BadgerDAO, including product mix, leadership, treasury allocation, and community initiatives. The governance of Badger Finance is managed via an Aragon DAO.\n- BADGER can also be used to earn staking rewards and as collateral on different platforms across DeFi.\n- Holding BADGER in your wallet (or staked as bBADGER) increases your APYs in other Sett Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThe Badger governance token ($BADGER) and the Digg token ($DIGG) аrе distributed via airdrops for users:\n\n- who have demonstrated an active interest in Bitcoin DeFi and community governance\n- are early contributors to the DAO,\n- and as staking rewards for participation in Sett.", en: "**Project Description**\n\nBadgerDAO is an open-source, decentralized autonomous organization that is dedicated to building products and infrastructure, simplifying the use of Bitcoin as collateral across many smart contract platforms like Ethereum. \n\nIn simple terms, Badger enables earning DeFi yields on your Bitcoin.

If the price is between .95 and 1.05 BTC, the supply remains unchanged.\n\nThe smart contract works to push the circulating supply of DIGG closer to an equilibrium where the market demands an amount of DIGG such that its price equals the current price of BTC. Rebases change the number of DIGG tokens users see in their wallet, but does not change the percentage ownership of the total supply.\n\nHolding DIGG in the wallet (or staked as bDIGG) increases APYs in other Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nBADGER is the native governance token of BadgerDAO. It is an ERC-20 token with a maximum fixed supply of 21 million. It is currently traded on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, with support for Fantom coming soon.\n\nThe BADGER token has the following applications:\n\n- BADGER tokens give its owner the right to vote in the governance of BadgerDAO, including product mix, leadership, treasury allocation, and community initiatives. The governance of Badger Finance is managed via an Aragon DAO.\n- BADGER can also be used to earn staking rewards and as collateral on different platforms across DeFi.\n- Holding BADGER in your wallet (or staked as bBADGER) increases your APYs in other Sett Vaults as part of the Badger Boost system.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThe Badger governance token ($BADGER) and the Digg token ($DIGG) аrе distributed via airdrops for users:\n\n- who have demonstrated an active interest in Bitcoin DeFi and community governance\n- are early contributors to the DAO,\n- and as staking rewards for participation in Sett.", fr: "**Project Description**\n\nBadgerDAO is an open-source, decentralized autonomous organization that is dedicated to building products and infrastructure, simplifying the use of Bitcoin as collateral across many smart contract platforms like Ethereum. \n\nIn simple terms, Badger enables earning DeFi yields on your Bitcoin. Badger provides tools that allow someone to bring Bitcoin into the DeFi ecosystem and earn the best risk-adjusted yield possible, automatically rebalancing into better strategies as they become available.\n\nThe platform is a shared space where the developers, known as Badge Builders, have the ability to collaborate and implement Bitcoin as collateral to as many blockchains as possible. \n\nThere is an incentive for developers to build on the platform as they can earn a percentage of the fees from users and BADGER tokens from the developer pool for every implementation.\n\nBadger DAO products include:\n\n1) Sett Vaults\n\nAllow someone to deposit over twenty Bitcoin-linked crypto assets into smart contracts that execute automated strategies to achieve some of the best risk-adjusted rewards across DeFi. Some strategies involve securely lending the assets to earn interest, providing liquidity to traders, or \"farming\" the governance tokens of other DeFi protocols. \n\nSome Vaults are upgradable, meaning they can switch between strategies when new opportunities become available.\n\n2) ibBTC token \n\nInterest Bearing Bitcoin (ibBTC) is a fully collateralized representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum, Matic, and BSC. The goal of ibBTC is to become the most liquid, secure, and widely used BTC-backed asset throughout DeFi, while at the same time providing users with a base interest rate from holding it. \n\nBuilt in collaboration with DefiDollar, ibBTC is an index of the top Bitcoin-pegged assets in DeFi, including wBTC, renBTC, sBTC, and tBTC. Users are able to create ibBTC by providing byvWBTC, bCrvRenWBTC, bCrvRenWSBTC, or bCrvtBTC tokens.\n\nOnce minted, BadgerDAO manages the assets to provide a base interest rate that is derived from the return of the underlying Sett Vaults. ibBTC may be redeemed for the underlying vault tokens at any time or traded on exchanges like Sushiswap.\n\nWhile the ibBTC token already earns yield from holding it, owners are also able to deposit the ibBTC token together with the WBTC token as liquidity to Sushiswap pools and earn SUSHI tokens as a reward.\n\n3) Badger Bridge \n\nBadger Bridge is a core product of BadgerDAO, managed in collaboration with the Ren Protocol. It allows users to bring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain into Ethereum, and receive either a renBTC or WBTC token. Both renBTC and wBTC are fully collateralized representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum, meaning they are backed 1:1 with Bitcoin and can be swapped back into BTC at any time with very low slippage.\n\nBoth renBTC and wBTC may be deposited into Sett Vaults to earn yield, used as collateral on other protocols, swapped for different tokens, or any of the hundreds of other uses across DeFi.\n\n4) Badger Boost\n\nBadger Boost encourages users to participate in governance and support the BadgerDAO ecosystem by holding Badger native assets - BADGER and DIGG in their wallets. For that, users are rewarded with BADGER tokens.\n\nBadger Boost adjusts the amount of BADGER rewards a user receives, based on the ratio of a user's native balance (bBadger or a DIGG LP) compared to a non-native balance (funds deposited into BTC Setts). The higher the native balance, the more BADGER token rewards users receive on non-native Vault positions.\n\n5) DIGG\n\nDIGG is the first decentralized, elastic supply crypto asset pegged to the price of Bitcoin. Unlike custodial forms of BTC on Ethereum, DIGG is not backed by Bitcoin under management. Instead, DIGG relies on parameters built into its smart contracts in order to maintain a loose peg to BTC.\n\nEvery day, a rebase occurs. If the price of DIGG is greater than 1.05 BTC, a positive rebase occurs and the supply of DIGG in wallets and smart contracts increases. If the price is under .95 BTC, the supply decreases.

This rewards early supporters and has the aim of creating highly incentivized token holders to contribute to the project. \n\nFor instance, wBNB tokens collected by the platform as vault fees are used to purchase BIFI tokens from the open market. These purchased tokens are then distributed to anyone who has staked into the BIFI max vault.' } },

Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin, have no way of knowing anything that happens outside their own blockchain network. \n\nBlockchains running on the Cosmos network can communicate with each other through the Cosmos Hub underlying blockchain via the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC).\n\nThe main feature of the Cosmos Hub blockchain is cross-chain solutions that allow any blockchain to be launched in the Cosmos ecosystem to interact both with each other, and with external networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nCosmos has had several challenges in its creation: to solve scalability, usability, and interoperability problems that limit developers to only one network.

This means that the Litecoin platform is significantly less protected from outside interference.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nThe native unit of currency in the Litecoin network is also called Litecoin, denoted by the LTC symbol and divisible into 100,000,000 subunits.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThere can be up to 84 million LTC coin units which is 4 times larger than that of Bitcoin. About 65-70 million are already in circulation.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, about every 4 years (equivalent to 840,000 blocks) the reward the miner gets for processing a block of transactions is cut in half. It currently stands at 12.5 LTC (until August 2023).\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Medium\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >>  Yes' } },

  { uid: 'near', description: { de: '**Project Description**\n\nNear Protocol is a blockchain platform for creating and running decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. One of the advantages is its high scalability, allowing the protocol to process 100,000 transactions per second. For comparison, the Bitcoin blockchain processes 7 transactions per second, and Ethereum 25 transactions per second. \n\nFor interoperability of its network, Near Protocol uses the so-called Rainbow bridge connecting the Ethereum and Near blockchains, which allows users to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another. \n\n- To transfer assets from Ethereum to Near, a user will need to block the desired amount of tokens in ETH network storage and, upon confirmation of token blocking, Near releases, the blocked amount of tokens in its network and the user will be able to use them.\n- To transfer the tokens back from the Near network to ETH network, tokens must be burned (destroyed) in the Near network, then, upon confirmation of withdrawal of the tokens from circulation, ETH will unblock the tokens for circulation on its network.\n\nDApp developers are attracted to Near Protocol because of the convenience of application creation, where they can use familiar languages (Rust, AssemblyScript and Solidity languages used in Ethereum).\n\n**Token Description**\n\nNEAR is a native token of the Near Protocol. The token can be used in the network governance by validator nodes and delegating participants. The token is mined (issued) through staking by validators and participants delegating their funds to the network validators.\n\n**Token emission**\n\nThe total issue is 1,000,000,000 NEAR tokens. Annual token inflation is approximately 5% per year, which gradually turns to deflation and should eventually reach 0%.

  { uid: 'ripple', description: { de: '**Project Description**\n\nXRP Ledger is an open-source, permissionless, peer-to-peer payment network that allows fast transactions.

The company is funded through their own reserves of XRP as well as by private investments from Andressen Horowitz, Google Ventures and others. \n\nWhen compared to other projects in the crypto ecosystem, XRP Ledger is relatively less decentralized because of Ripple’s heavy involvement as one of the driving forces of adoption. It is also important to note that approximately 21% of the validator nodes on the network are controlled by the Ripple company.\n\nXRP Ledger is integrated with a number of commercial non-open (permissioned) services from Ripple, like RippleNet, a permissioned payment network comprised of over 300 institutions (banks, payment providers, brokers, unions) that serve as independent users and transaction validators on the network.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nXRP is the native digital currency supported by XRP Ledger. XRP is measured precisely to the nearest 0.000001 XRP, called a drop.\n\nEvery transaction on the Ripple network requires a tiny commission fee of 10 drops (.00001 XRP) which gets destroyed. \n\nAlso, a minimum balance of 20 XRP is required to be held in each wallet address.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nAt inception, 100 billion XRP tokens were created and fixed to be the maximum supply cap. 80 billion XRP were allocated in the form of a grant to the Ripple company.\n\nAccording to the Ripple company, approximately 50 billion XRP is currently being held in escrow with a maximum of 1 billion XRP released on a monthly basis for sale to fund its activities. It is important to note that several reports from independent data providers have surfaced that discuss some discrepancies with how the XRP supply is disseminated.\n\nThe majority of the XRP supply is still held by the Ripple founders and the\ncompany.

  { uid: 'solana', description: { de: "**Project Description**\n\nFounded in 2017, Solana is a high-performance cryptocurrency blockchain which supports smart contracts. \n\nIt's currently one of the leading 3rd generation blockchains, along with blockchains like Avalanche or Algorand, that aims to serve as a foundational layer for decentralized applications.\n\nSolana can theoretically process up to 70,000 transactions per second (compared to Bitcoin’s 7 TPS and Ethereum’s 15 TPS).

Today the project is maintained by a non-profit TRON Foundation.\n\nTRON is often compared to Ethereum, due to the many similarities the projects share. Like Ethereum, TRON enables developers to create autonomous financial and other services powered by smart contracts. Although the platform enables free and considerably faster transactions, it's nowhere near  Ethereum when it comes to the amount of value locked in the services operating on top of the blockchain. \n\nOn 25 July 2018, the TRON Foundation announced it had acquired BitTorrent, the biggest peer-to-peer file-sharing network. Later, the BitTorrent ecosystem got its own token on the TRON platform.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nThe native unit of currency in the TRON blockchain network is TRONix, denoted by the symbol TRX. While transactions are nearly free, they still require a tiny bit of TRX tokens as a measure against spam attacks. \n\nTRX token holders may stake their holdings with the protocol and earn passive income. The more users stake, the more TRON Power (TP) they earn. TP tokens can then be used for voting on Super Representatives on the blockchain, who are tasked with producing blocks. \n\n**Token Emission**\n\nIn 2017, the TRON Foundation conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) and [r](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2157587/tron-cashed-us70-m-coin-sale-chinas-ico-ban-where-it-going)aised about $70 million for further development of the TRON blockchain and ecosystem around it. There was an initial issuance of 100 billion TRX tokens.\n\nInitially, the TRON blockchain used to award 32 TRX tokens to one of the Super Representatives powering the network with every new block, roughly every 3 seconds. At the same time, 16 TRX were awarded to one of the witness nodes (or Super Representative Candidate). As a result, the approximated daily inflation is 1.38 million TRX and the approximated yearly inflation is over 500 million TRX.\n\nLater, the community voted to change this incentive mechanism. Rewards for each block were lowered from 32 TRX to 16 TRX, while the amount of voting rewards increased tenfold to 160 TRX which gets split between the top 127 SRs, proportionally to the number of votes they received.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Low\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> Yes", en: "**Project Description**\n\nTRON was launched by Justin Sun in 2016, initially as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and later in 2018 as an independent blockchain with its own native token.

In comparison, every single Bitcoin transaction exposes some information about the sender's balance, as well as past and future transactions. The Zcash blockchain allows transactions which are verifiable for validity by any third party, without exposing the private data of the entities involved in that transaction. \n\n**Token Emission**\n\nZcash is actually a fork of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency project and shares a lot of fundamental properties, including a limited supply of up to 21 million ZEC tokens.\n\nNew ZEC units are created each time a block is added to the Zcash blockchain. New blocks are created roughly every 75 seconds.\n\nThe ZEC supply curve mirrors Bitcoin's. However, the number of ZEC created per Zcash block is 1/8 the number of BTC created per Bitcoin block.\n\nThe first weeks after Zcash's launch were a \"slow-start\" mining period. During that period, the amount of ZEC each time a block was mined started at zero, and gradually ramped up to 12.5 ZEC after 34 days. \n\nThe slow-start period ended on December 1st, 2016.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> High\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> Yes", en: "**Project Description**\n\nZcash grew out of an experimental proposal from a group of scientists and mathematicians looking to fix а lack of privacy on Bitcoin. \n\nZcash launched on October 28, 2016 by Electric Coin Co, and was the first cryptocurrency project making use of zk-SNARK's technology, also known as zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin blockchain takes about 10 minutes to process a block with new transactions, on Zcash, the blocks are on average processed once every 75 seconds (1.25 minutes) making it faster.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nThe native unit of currency in the Zcash network is denoted by the symbol ZEC, and is divisible into 100,000,000 subunits, known as zatoshi. \n\nThe main use of ZEC currency lies in the ability to conduct anonymous transactions.

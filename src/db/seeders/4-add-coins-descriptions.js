Along with Avalanche and Solana, Algorand is one of the key contenders to Ethereum.\n\nAlgorand is headed by a strong team from MIT and other academic institutions. It was founded by a turning award-winning MIT cryptography professor called Silvio Micali, who has conceived a number of key technologies currently used in blockchains, such as zero-knowledge proofs. So to say that he is accomplished in the field of cryptography is an understatement. \n\nThe project raised a large amount of money through 2 private sales and one public sale - over 120 million dollars - from funds like Union Square Ventures and many others. \n\nThe proceeds of the sales have been used by the team to finance the development of the community, academics involved in the project, and the development of the Algorand blockchain ecosystem.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nThe native cryptocurrency on the Algorand blockchain is known as Algo and is denoted as ALGO.\n\nAs is the case with most proof-of-stake blockchains, Algo token holders may stake their holdings with the protocol and earn rewards in the form of newly emitted tokens by the protocol. Also, a small amount of Algo is required to execute a transaction on the blockchain.\n\nFinally, Algo token holders are in charge of governance and control the direction of the Algorand protocol.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nAt the genesis of the Algorand blockchain, 10 billion ALGO was minted and represents the fixed and immutable maximum supply of the Algo cryptocurrency. About 30% of that amount was in circulation as of April 2021. \n\n2.5 billion of initially minted tokens were primarily assigned to Algorand Inc (2 billion ALGO) and the Algorand Foundation (500 million ALGO).\n\nThe remaining supply of 7 billion ALGO is expected to be in circulation by the end of 2030 and distributed in the following manner:\n\n- Community Incentives: 6.2 billion ALGO\n- Ecosystem Support: 1.25 billion ALGO\n\nWhile the ALGO emission rate is going to remain pretty high over the next 9 years, it should facilitate a more democratic distribution of ALGO tokens in the ecosystem.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Medium\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> Yes', en: '**Project Description**\n\nAlgorand is a scalable, secure, and decentralized cryptocurrency and smart contract platform. The Algorand blockchain finalizes blocks in seconds and provides immediate transaction finality.

  { uid: 'ripple', description: { de: '**Project Description**\n\nXRP Ledger is an open-source, permissionless, peer-to-peer payment network that allows fast transactions. It was designed to challenge existing financial systems, eliminate high fees, reduce processing times, and address liquidity challenges faced by financial institutions when using traditional payment channels (i.e. SWIFT, ACH, FedWire etc). \n\nToday, the development of XRP Ledger is driven primarily by Ripple, a privately owned company. The company is funded through their own reserves of XRP as well as by private investments from Andressen Horowitz, Google Ventures and others. \n\nWhen compared to other projects in the crypto ecosystem, XRP Ledger is relatively less decentralized because of Ripple’s heavy involvement as one of the driving forces of adoption. It is also important to note that approximately 21% of the validator nodes on the network are controlled by the Ripple company.\n\nXRP Ledger is integrated with a number of commercial non-open (permissioned) services from Ripple, like RippleNet, a permissioned payment network comprised of over 300 institutions (banks, payment providers, brokers, unions) that serve as independent users and transaction validators on the network.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nXRP is the native digital currency supported by XRP Ledger. XRP is measured precisely to the nearest 0.000001 XRP, called a drop.\n\nEvery transaction on the Ripple network requires a tiny commission fee of 10 drops (.00001 XRP) which gets destroyed. \n\nAlso, a minimum balance of 20 XRP is required to be held in each wallet address.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nAt inception, 100 billion XRP tokens were created and fixed to be the maximum supply cap. 80 billion XRP were allocated in the form of a grant to the Ripple company.\n\nAccording to the Ripple company, approximately 50 billion XRP is currently being held in escrow with a maximum of 1 billion XRP released on a monthly basis for sale to fund its activities.

One MSRM is equal to 1 million SRM.\n\nSRM is Serum’s governance token that is primarily an SPL token (Solana's token standard) but is cross-listed as ERC20 on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n**Token Emission**\n\nThere is a maximum supply of 10 billion SRM tokens. \n\n- 10% of those were unlocked from the start with a large portion of them meant as incentives for service users.\n- The remaining 90% are to be released linearly over a 6 year period between 2022 and 2027.\n- All seed sales were locked.\n\nSerum uses 80% of the revenue generated by the exchange to buy back and burn SRM tokens every week. \n\nThe remaining 20% gets distributed to SRM stakers that have locked their holding in Serum's staking contract.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Low\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> No" } },

Today the project is maintained by a non-profit TRON Foundation.\n\nTRON is often compared to Ethereum, due to the many similarities the projects share. Like Ethereum, TRON enables developers to create autonomous financial and other services powered by smart contracts. Although the platform enables free and considerably faster transactions, it's nowhere near  Ethereum when it comes to the amount of value locked in the services operating on top of the blockchain. \n\nOn 25 July 2018, the TRON Foundation announced it had acquired BitTorrent, the biggest peer-to-peer file-sharing network. Later, the BitTorrent ecosystem got its own token on the TRON platform.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nThe native unit of currency in the TRON blockchain network is TRONix, denoted by the symbol TRX. While transactions are nearly free, they still require a tiny bit of TRX tokens as a measure against spam attacks. \n\nTRX token holders may stake their holdings with the protocol and earn passive income. The more users stake, the more TRON Power (TP) they earn. TP tokens can then be used for voting on Super Representatives on the blockchain, who are tasked with producing blocks. \n\n**Token Emission**\n\nIn 2017, the TRON Foundation conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) and [r](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2157587/tron-cashed-us70-m-coin-sale-chinas-ico-ban-where-it-going)aised about $70 million for further development of the TRON blockchain and ecosystem around it. There was an initial issuance of 100 billion TRX tokens.\n\nInitially, the TRON blockchain used to award 32 TRX tokens to one of the Super Representatives powering the network with every new block, roughly every 3 seconds. At the same time, 16 TRX were awarded to one of the witness nodes (or Super Representative Candidate). As a result, the approximated daily inflation is 1.38 million TRX and the approximated yearly inflation is over 500 million TRX.\n\nLater, the community voted to change this incentive mechanism. Rewards for each block were lowered from 32 TRX to 16 TRX, while the amount of voting rewards increased tenfold to 160 TRX which gets split between the top 127 SRs, proportionally to the number of votes they received.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Low\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> Yes", en: "**Project Description**\n\nTRON was launched by Justin Sun in 2016, initially as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and later in 2018 as an independent blockchain with its own native token.

Later, the BitTorrent ecosystem got its own token on the TRON platform.\n\n**Token Description**\n\nThe native unit of currency in the TRON blockchain network is TRONix, denoted by the symbol TRX. While transactions are nearly free, they still require a tiny bit of TRX tokens as a measure against spam attacks. \n\nTRX token holders may stake their holdings with the protocol and earn passive income. The more users stake, the more TRON Power (TP) they earn. TP tokens can then be used for voting on Super Representatives on the blockchain, who are tasked with producing blocks. \n\n**Token Emission**\n\nIn 2017, the TRON Foundation conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) and [r](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2157587/tron-cashed-us70-m-coin-sale-chinas-ico-ban-where-it-going)aised about $70 million for further development of the TRON blockchain and ecosystem around it. There was an initial issuance of 100 billion TRX tokens.\n\nInitially, the TRON blockchain used to award 32 TRX tokens to one of the Super Representatives powering the network with every new block, roughly every 3 seconds. At the same time, 16 TRX were awarded to one of the witness nodes (or Super Representative Candidate). As a result, the approximated daily inflation is 1.38 million TRX and the approximated yearly inflation is over 500 million TRX.\n\nLater, the community voted to change this incentive mechanism. Rewards for each block were lowered from 32 TRX to 16 TRX, while the amount of voting rewards increased tenfold to 160 TRX which gets split between the top 127 SRs, proportionally to the number of votes they received.\n\n **Token Parameters**\n\n- Privacy >> Low\n- Issuance >> Decentralized\n- Confiscation-resistance >> High\n- Censorship-resistance >> High\n- Audited >> Yes", ru: "**Project Description**\n\nTRON was launched by Justin Sun in 2016, initially as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and later in 2018 as an independent blockchain with its own native token.
